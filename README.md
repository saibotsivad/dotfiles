# dotfiles

Dotfiles for command line stuff.

## personal note:

To setup a new computer, log in to the Dropbox website and view the computer setup file.

## run setup

In this folder you will want to run:

    ./setup-COMPUTER.sh

Where `COMPUTER` is any of the computer names.

## npm

With npm@5+ you can use `npx`, so I also turned this into a handy dandy npm launcher thing.

You can do something like:

```sh
npx saibotsivad/dotfiles $COMMAND --param=$PARAM
```
